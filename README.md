SPARK Prove Analysis Tool

= Introduction

The SPARK tools (i.e. GNATprove) leave behing a trove of information after a proof run.
This tool is intended to take these and extract some useful information out of it (like
for example, where the provers spent their time, which provers solved the problem first
etc. pp.).

The idea is that making use of that information will help identify and fix bottlenecks
during proof.
